Air Quality Egg Helper
============

Browser extension which adds useful markup to Air Quality Egg pages hosted by Cosm.

This extension offers several minor tweaks to the standard Air Quality Egg page provided by Cosm:

* add units to measurements
* show the temperature in Fahrenheit
* show the last update time in local time rather than UTC
* show the last update time relatively ("Last Updated 1 minute ago")
* show a link to the raw feed for this egg
* add a favicon to the page (currently the favicon link is 404)
* automatically refresh the page

These tweaks can all be controlled via an options page.

Currently the extension only supports Google's Chrome browser.

The Chrome extension is available at the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/air-quality-egg-helper/gecpnhhbbfkhjojmijgnpcdmelaokflm
